'''*operator is a symbol that is used to perform operations on data values and variables.
There are many types of operators in python like arithmetic operators, relational operators, logical operators,
assignment operators, bitwise operators, membership operators, and identity operators.
    1 .arthmetic operatorsare used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction,
      multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and floor division.
     >>example:+, -, *, /, %, **, //(** is call exponentiation operator and // is call floor division operator)
    2. relational operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean value.
     >> example:==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
    3. logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions and return a boolean value.
     >>example:and, or, not
    4. assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
    >> example: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=
    5. bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on integers.
     >>example:&(and), |(or), ^(xor), ~(not), <<(left shift), >>(right shift)
    6. membership operators are used to check if a value is present in a sequence.
     >>example:in, not in
    7. identity operators are used to check if two variables refer to the same object.
     >>example:is, is not
